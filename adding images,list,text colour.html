<div>
<p align="left">Hello! Welcome to my site. This site will help you find better place to stay while you are at Taita Taveta University.
As you know the weather around TTU it's semi-arid,sometimes it's extremely hot during the day and it gets brass monkeys at 
night. When rains come it becomes really messy with the mud too. It rains cats and dogs. For this reason I decided to do a research to 
help you find a better stay.
</p>

<p2 align="center"> Getting a good house for your settlement as a student is a good idea, you dont want to stay in a place where you walk a 
thousand miles to fetch water or to get to a restaurant. You are a student and time is of great value to you,you don't want 
to waste it. For this reason I decided to create this site to help all students save time and also to guide the RE investors,
that is to hint to you on areas you need to improve on to make a students life comfortable while staying in your respective 
houses</p2>
</div>
